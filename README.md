# 3. Settings & Usage
## Application Forms

By default a form named Form 1 is ready for use. This default form can not be changed. Create your a new form if you want to customize your application form:
1. Each apply form can also be used for different kind of publications (see settings under [Sources](#sources --> Apply Form) )
2. The **Synchronize with Carerix button** checks if fields that use values from the Carerix System are available. For example, if it can not find any values for the Nationality field, that field will be disabled.
3. Set each fields to Visible of Required
4. You can reorder fields with drag and drop and you can drag & drop whole sections (on the right side)
5. Copy paste the shortcode of the form to the page where you want to use it as an 'Open Application form', for example:
```
[cx_open_application openFormID="2"]
```

See the parameters for Open Application below

### Open Application form

<table>
   <tr>
      <td>[cx_open_application]</th>
      <td>Use this shortcode in the content of a page</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>[cx_open_application openFormID="XX"]</td>
      <td>Use for a specific application form. Replace 'XX' by the application form ID. You can find the ID in the application forms list (Wordpress ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Carerix ‚Üí Application Forms).</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>[cx_open_application openpubid="XX"]</td>
      <td>If you have multiple open vacancies in your Carerix system, you can add the Carerix publication-ID of the specific open vacancy as a parameter.
	      <BR/>
         Replace 'XX' by the ID of the publication of the open vacancy job order
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>[cx_open_application openFormID="3" openpubid="312"]</td>
      <td>You can combine the two parameters like this</td>
   </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>

### Settings of a (custom) Application Form
You can create a new form and link it to the desired Job feed source. For each form you can synchronize the fields from Carerix.
Note that you must first save the title of the form before you can synchronize. You can compose each form yourself by or (un)checking the appropriate (and/or required) fields.

* üî¥ KLOPT DIT NOG (Dit is nu toch een shortcode?): Show login link: set to Yes by default. If enabled, it generates the login link in the job details page.
* Extra apply options: Set to no by default. If enabled it generates the Apply with Linkedin link
* Address format: International / Dutch. For Dutch each field is split on it's own form field while for International the entire addres can be inserted in one textarea.
* Agreement link (No agreement link by default):
    * Insert desired text in the ‚ÄúAgreement Label‚Äù and in ‚ÄúAgreement text‚Äù fields to display the link.
    * Insert an URL to be associated with the agreement text url. If Agreement URL field is filled it takes precedent over the Agreement text.
* Captcha: Choose to display the Captcha code
* Advanced: Clear Datanodes Cache. If you made a change in the Carerix System to one of the DataNodes used here, you should clean the cache.


## Sources
Under the Sources section you can create one or more Jobs sources. You can use the Default jobs source or you can create a custom form:

* Use a different other settings or a different template lay out for your vacancy posts
* Use a different Carerix  'medium'-code (like 'web' or 'web2' or 'web-en')

### Configuring a Job source
1. Add a new Jobs source click via Add New button.
2. When you Add or edit a Source you need to synchronize to see changes
3. Deleting a source will not delete the generated posts from wordpress but only that specific source
4. The following fields can be set:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Source name</td>
        <td>Helps you to identify the configured source.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Publications Details Options</td>
        <td>Here you can set options for how the applicant will see and interact with the vacancy posts generated from this source. üî¥IMAGE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Apply Form</td>
        <td>Select the Application Form to be used for this specific Source</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Title - Location</td>
        <td>Select if you want to show the work location after the Title or not.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Set Alternative Feed Source Parameters</td>
        <td>You can specify a different 'medium'-code here. It's useful if you have multiple sites or brands with different sets of vacancies. Therefore these 'medium'-codes are active and in use in the Carerix application. üî¥IMAGE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Publication Details Header and Publication Details Footer</td>
        <td>If you want to display details in the footer or the header, use the following shortcodes: üî¥IMAGE</td>
    </tr>
</table>

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

* **Publication Excerpt**
Here you can use an alternative/better teaser (summary text) which will be used as a summary, specifically in vacancy overview/listing pages. This excerpt will also be used as intro/description text as preview text on Social Media etc.

* **Publication Details Body**
You can use shortcodes like [cx_intro_information], [cx_offer_information] and many more to setup your own vacancy layout template. See the shortcodes in the plugin for exact usage. Please read the accompanying usage explanation in the plugin as you are configuring the job source.
üî¥IMAGE

### üî¥ Shortcodes for Publication body
üî¥ \[SHORTCODES\]

Medium 'web' is default, but you can show a different 'job flow' on the website. For example, a list of ZZP projects or jobs per establishment, all published to medium 'web2'.
You can do this by publishing to a different medium. You use this medium as follows:

### Additional Job sources with a different medium
1. In the Carerix application: Create a new medium, for example web2 (only admins can create a medium)
2. Publish least one job created for this different medium
3. In WordPress, go to the Carerix WordPress plugin settings
4. Create a new job flow to (a new ‚ÄòSource‚Äò)
5. Fill the medium behind https://appname.carerix.com/cxtools/wp_feed.php? as follows: `medium=web2` and save
6. During synchronization, created an additional WordPress main category, it is given the name of this additional media
7. You can show you the various job listings through blog lists or tags.

> [!NOTE]
> In Carerix publish your default to the medium 'web'. You do this in the settings of the Carerix WordPress plugin to fill out and you therefore blank.

## Taxonomies
The plugin is generating Taxonomies for Jobs posts:
* Countries - Country
* Regions - Region
* Educations - Education 0
* Functiongroup - Function 0
* Functions - Function 1
* Work locations - Publication work location

In order to use the taxonomies as filters for the 2 types of posts, the names of the taxonomies must be distinct. Otherwise, if common, the values of the taxonomies will be displayed for both type of posts and the user will experience that after sellecting a taxonomy no result will be returned.

Default resources are used to generate the names of the taxonomies. The language applied will follow the language of the plugin.

Define your own values for the taxonomies creating for each languge a different / new value to overwrite the default ones filled from resources.



## Job Alert Subscription
In WordPress you can use this shortcode to show a form for job alerts (vacancy subscription). When candidates signup they will receive emails in the future containing vacancies that fit their selected criteria, on a daily basis.
You can create a standalone Job Alert Subscription page, using this shortcode:

````
[cx_job_alert_subscription frequency="daily|bidaily|tridaily|twiceweekly|weekly|biweekly|monthly"
confirmation_message="Thank you for subscribing. Shortly you will receive an email with an activation link.
After activation you will start receiving new job opportunities in your mailbox on a daily basis!"
confirmation_url="/jobalert_thank_you/"]
````

The following fields will be displayed in the form:

* Email address
* First name
* Last name (and prefix)
* Gender
* Country selection preference \
(only if multiple countries are published in Carerix)
* Three ‚Äúsub region‚Äù selector preferences like provinces, counties and departments \
(only if these are published in Carerix)
* Two function group preferences with an optional parent business-line selector \
(the business-line selector will only appear if multiple business-lines are published in Carerix)
* Agreement to terms checkbox (also enforces the storage term of the personal information to comply to GDPR)
* Anti bot abuse system (by Captcha)

The process for the candidate is as follows:

1. Candidate selects the criteria which job opportunities to receive and submits the form
2. Candidate receives an opt-in activation mail and clicks on the activation link
3. Candidate is subscribed and starts receiving mail with (new) vacancies on a (daily) basis that match the selected criteria
4. To cancel, the candidate can use the unsubscribe link in the job alert mails

### Jobalert Step 1: Preparation in Carerix
Follow the steps in the following help article:
1. Follow the steps in the following help article: [Helpdeks: Job alert](https://help.carerix.com/en/articles/1954170)
2. Make sure these email template are installed
* `web-subscribe` (‚ÄúVacancy subscription confirmation / Vacature abonnement bevestiging‚Äù)
* `jobalert` (The daily/weekly mailing it self)

### Jobalert Step 2: Use the Shortcode in Wordpress
1. Create a general page and use above shortcode in the content

### Jobalert Step 3: Fine-tuning in Carerix
In Carerix, you can fine-tune the following candidate criteria for the job alert form:
* Country selection
* Business-line selection
* Function group selection

For the following instructions you need to be familiar with Carerix Tables editing. The principles explained in[ Table management](https://help.carerix.com/en/articles/1810726) are used to edit the tables.

The following table items are used:

* For countries the table 'Land' (country)
* For business-lines the table 'Vakgebied' (business-line)
* For function groups the table 'functie0'

#### Shorten the country selection
If your working area is a single country (or a few) you can shorten the dropdown box of countries. For each country you do not want show in the job alert form, 
1. In Carerix go to Tables 
3. Edit the item, and uncheck the box ‚Äú**not for web**‚Äù.
Note: if you only enable one country, the country selection is disabled on the job alert form.

#### Shorten the business-line selection
In Carerix every function group can be connected to a business-line. If one or more function groups are connected to a business-line the business-line dropdown box on the jobalert form will appear. So if you don't work with multiple business-lines, you need to configure the business-lines as follows:

1. In Carerix Edit each business-line item in the table ‚Äú**vakgebied**‚Äù (business-line) and enable the checkbox ‚Äú**not for web**‚Äù
2. Locate the business-line ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù (default) and disable the checkbox ‚Äúnot for web‚Äù. This leaves you with one mandatory business-line which will NOT appear for candidates on the job alert form
3. In Wordpress, go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Carerix** ‚Üí **Application Forms** ‚Üí Tab: **Settings**, and click on ‚Äú**Clear DataNodes cache**‚Äù

#### Configure/shorten function group selection
1. In Carerix Edit each function group item (table: **functie0**) you want to include in the group selection for the candidates.
Disable 'not for web' and enable each desired business-line you want to connect the function group to. You need at least connect it to one business-line
2. In Wordpress, go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Carerix** ‚Üí **Application Forms** ‚Üí Tab: **Settings**, and click on ‚Äú**Clear DataNodes cache**‚Äù

## Multilingual Websites

The Carerix WordPress plugin supports multilingualism. To do this, you use a multilingual plugin. Carerix supports [Multilingual Plugin WPML](http://wpml.org/), the most popular plugin on multilingualism. We assume that you all vacancies in both Dutch as a 2nd language publishing (English in this example). Proceed as follows

1. Make Carerix in another medium (in tables). You've already medium 'web', add a new medium to eg code web-en 'for English.
2. Create an additional publications of a job
3. One publication (1st language) already has the medium `web`. Make an extra publication of the same job and web (2nd language) with it. Please note that this publication contains the texts in the 2nd language.
4. Go to the WordPress Website
5. Install WPML and adjust it as desired
6. Go to the Carerix settings and synchronize all items Carerix
7. In the list of all messages (posts) you can see which posts have been published in any language

Use the medium code 'web-XX', where 'XX' is the ICU Locale language.

The Carerix plugin works perfectly with WPML, one of the best WordPress plugins multilingual. The price WPML is worth it, see [WPML](https://wpml.org/)


## Without multilingual plugin
IMPORTANT! You can do steps below only in case when WPML plugin is NOT installed. If you have WPML plugin please skip this section!

You can also show jobs from different languages ‚Äã‚Äã(different mediums) without multilingual plugin:

1. Create a medium (per language) a separate job to feed source,
2. On Set Feed Source Parameters Add `medium=web` and as parameter behind `/cxtools/wp_feed.php?`
3. You now have several job feeds, jobs are created as separate jobs in the'd really rather know categories. The page is created only displays the jobs with the medium 'and web.


_____________



## Diagnostics (since v3.0.0)

The jobs synchronizing process will be fully handled by the REST API. The diagnostics tool (**Wordpress Dashboard** ‚Üí **Carerix** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Tab Diagnostics**) will help you find possible inconsistencies between published vacancies in your Carerix system and the vacancies that are retrieved by your Wordpress site.

You can review the 'active job publications' but also the available 'medium codes'.
* General plugin (version) information (Active mediums, Open application found, etc)
* Active job publications (synced from Carerix, with Pub ID, Title, start date, Visibility sensitive data)
* Available mediums (in Carerix)

---

# üî¥ 4. Advanced Features (Optional)

* For developers or experienced users, this section can cover:
    * Hooks and filters used by the plugin.
    * Custom functions available.
    * Integration with other plugins or WordPress APIs.

---

## Special jobs
üî¥ CHECKEN
Website in one language but do you want multiple languages used for publication texts?
If you have a website entirely in Dutch but you want to display one or more jobs in a different language? By default, your publications will receive all header sections in Dutch. take the following steps in order to have the labels in the correct language.

**In Carerix:**
1. If an extra medium for language is not already active: Create a medium with the desired code (i.e. 'web-en') for use of publications in the different language of the website.
2. Create publications in this medium in the extra language that you need to publish

**In the WordPress plugin** (under Sources)

1. Create new source to generate your jobs page. **Eg. Page name: Mixed jobs**
2. In the Set Feed Source Parameters section, after the default feed, in the input text insert **Eg. for English:** `medium=web|web-en`
3. If you want to mix the Vacancy posts from the different languages you can use `medium=web|web-en`. 
4. Finish the rest of settings and save.

**Result:** Page named **Mixed Jobs** is created. The page will display jobs from the 2 defined mediums.

For the posts for which value of parameter medium is found to be language codes, the resources will be generated in the language code corresponding to language code. 

**NOTE**: If you do not want to use multilanguage-features, never use a mediumcode containing a dash. The Wordpress plugin will interpret it as a language resulting in English subtitles within your vacancies. So if you want to use a medium to separate vacancies for your second agency, use a mediumcode like ‚Äúwebagency2‚Äù instead of ‚Äúweb-agency2‚Äù


## Extra/Additional Carerix fields support (since v3.0.0)

You can find the feature in Carerix Dashboard‚ÜíCarerix‚ÜíSettings‚Üí tab Technology previews

In the Carerix system extra/additional fields can be added to Job orders and Publications. The information from these custom fields can be displayed in your vacancies. You can also use it as options in a ‚Äúvacancy-listing search&filter‚Äù widget.

**Use case**

A nice use case is a ‚Äúfeatured/highlighted‚Äù vacancy widget to highlight some vacancies. Therefore in Carerix you need to create an additional field called ‚Äúfeatured on website‚Äù (type single checkbox) and attach it to the ‚ÄúPublications entity‚Äù.  \
In Carerix, recruiters can tag preferred publications as ‚ÄúFeatured on website‚Äù.  \
 \
After that, the Wordpress developer can create a ‚ÄúFeatured vacancies widget‚Äù based on a ‚Äúvacancy post loop‚Äù restricted to the custom-field ‚Äúfeatured on website‚Äù.


## Google for Jobs

Google for Jobs is an enhanced search widget that aggregates listings from job boards and vacancy sites and displays them prominently in Google search.

To have your jobs included you need to add ‚Äústructured job posting data‚Äù to your job pages. This information is invisible, so your job pages are still looking the same. When Google is indexing your site, the structured data is recognized and added to Google for Jobs.

**Enabling and testing Google for Jobs**
* **Carerix** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí Tab '**Google for jobs**'
* Enable 'Google for Jobs support' and click on save changes
* Navigate to a vacancy information page of your choice at the front-end of your site
* Copy/paste the URL of the former step in the Google Structured Data testing tool:
* You will see the JobPosting entity is detected. The tool might give some warnings about recommended fields. Currently this information is not available in the CX WP plugin.

**Configuring yourself as hiring organization**

The hiring organization is also included in Google for Jobs. If you don't mark your jobs as ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù, your client (hiring organization) will be displayed. For jobs marked as anonymous you can put your own organization name as the hiring one. To do this fill in your own company name in the field ‚ÄúHiring organization‚Äù. Optionally you can also add your company logo.


## Job Conversion Tracking for web analytics

The Cx WP plugin supports custom code snippets for extended web analytics usage (e.g. Facebook pixel, Google Analytics, etc.)
Custom (javascript) code can be applied to the following webpage sections:


* General (basically  to all pages)
* Job description page
* Job application page
* Job application confirmation page

Additionally custom information (apply source and apply tags) can be set which will be stored in the ‚ÄúCandidate Match file‚Äù.

Configuring custom conversion/tracking code


* Note: understanding of/some skills in JavaScript is required
* As an administrator from your Wordpress Dashboard, navigate to **Carerix** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí Tab '**Conversion tracking**'
* Enter valid javascript code including &lt;script>-tags in the corresponding text-boxes
* You can access special global variables holding information like publication-ID, vacancy-ID and job title. The available variables names are displayed in the blue information box. Tip: you can also dump this information in your browser debug console by entering console.log(cx); at a vacancy description page.
* Finally you can use the methods cx.setApplySource() and cx.setApplyTags() to add extra information to the application (retrievable in the Carerix system under 'Matches')

## üî¥ CHECKEN: How to use the 'cxwordpress_post_updated' hook?
```
With this hook you can apply changes to a vacancy-post upon (creation/update) to have it better fit into your site/theme. It's useful to apply changes in text formatting or post-statuses.
Example, edit the file 'functions.php' in your activated child theme. Add the following:
function my_cx_post_preparation(array $postids, array $data, array $cxfields ) { $post_id = (int) $postids[0]; // First item is the WP post ID $post_data_v1 = $data[0]; // The original data that the CX WP plugin has saved/updated $_post = get_post( $post_id ); // Another way to access the post data $post_cxfields = $cxfields[0]; // First item holds an associative array of retrieved (raw) CX fields $pub_id = get_post_meta($post_id, 'guid', true); // CX publication ID // Example to retrieve some specific CX fields $cx_requirements = get_post_meta($post_id, 'requirementsInformation', true); $cx_function_group = get_the_terms($post_id, "functiongroups")[0]->name ?? ""; $cx_function_name = get_the_terms($post_id, "functions")[0]->name ?? ""; $cx_min_salary = $post_cxfields['minSalary'] + 0; $cx_max_salary = $post_cxfields['maxSalary'] + 0; $cx_period_salary = $post_cxfields['salaryPeriodClassification']; // MonthTag = per hour, HourTag = per month, etc. // Example to update the post content $_post ->post_content = "< h1 >Hook `cxwordpress_post_updated` altered this post contents!</ h1 >" . $_post ->post_content; wp_update_post( $_post ); // Update post // Example to set post meta info. This is specifically for posts in the Divi theme. Note "_et" is an abbreviation for Elegant Themes. update_post_meta( $post_id, '_et_pb_page_layout', 'et_full_width_page'); // force Divi post as a full width page update_post_meta( $post_id, '_et_pb_show_title', 'off'); // turn Divi post titles off // Clean cache wp_cache_delete( $post_id, 'posts' ); } // Add the hook with prio 3 (default) and accepting 3 arguments
add_action( 'cxwordpress_post_updated', 'my_cx_post_preparation', 10, 3);
```


## üî¥ CHECKEN: New method for language edits
You need (s)FTP credentials for the WordPress website to do this. The idea is to override portions of the plugin's language file within your own child theme. That way you are sure the language modifications aren't reverted when a new plugin version is released.
In this example we will change the heading text ‚ÄúIntroductie‚Äù (introduction) which appears in the vacancy texts. We assume you've set the Wordpress site language to Dutch and have the site running in a child theme.

**1. Create a blank PHP-file called**

`nl-NL.resources.php`

in {WORDPRESS-ROOT}/wp-content/themes/your-child-theme/CxWordpress/assets/resources/ Change your-child-theme to your child theme directory name and create the subdirectories (CxWordpress/assets/resources) if needed.

**2. Edit the new file**

'nl-NL.resources.php as follows'
```
;<?php die()?> [CxPortal.message.field] introduction = "Intro (formerly Introductie)" requirements = "Wat neem jij mee? (formerly Functie-eisen)" offer = "Wat bieden wij? (formerly Aanbod)" organization = "Over deze werkgever (formerly Organisatie)" function = "Wat ga je doen? (formerly Functie)" information = "Meer informatie (formerly Inlichtingen)" application = "Solliciteren bij (formerly Sollicitatie)" closingDate = "Sluitingsdatum (formerly Sluitdatum)" [general.button] apply = "Versturen (formerly Solliciteren)"
```
**3. Do a full sync from Carerix to regenerate the job posts**

**Wordpress Dashboard** ‚Üí **Carerix** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Button** ‚ÄúEnforce full sync of all items from Carerix‚Äù or ‚ÄúSynchronize new/changed items from Carerix‚Äù

**Notes**:
* Our new file nl-NL.resources.php is based on {WORDPRESS-ROOT}/wp-content/plugins/CxWordpress/assets/resources/nl-NL.resources.php. You can copy all desired elements from there to your own resource file.
* Each section of language elements starts with a section heading [xxxxxxx] (recognized by the brackets).

### How do I show the vacancies in other languages ‚Äã‚Äãon a multilingual website?

* For the Application Token see: [Application Token](#authorisation-of-the-plugin-for-the-specified-carerix-application)

### Why don't I see any vacancies?
Jobs are displayed under the following conditions (You need Carerix administrator):
* In Carerix, the medium-code of publications have to be set to web
(or intentionally match a custom medium-code which is used in the plugin)
* Last publication date is on or after today. Please note, check if necessary in the Carerix application:
    * Publication Basic tab: Last publication date
    * Publication Admin tab: Closing date
    * Job: Start Date

You can always verify if which publications have been synced during the last sync via the diagnostics tool (**Wordpress Dashboard** ‚Üí **Carerix** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Tab Diagnostics**)


### Can I edit the job posts?
Yes and No: You can manually add a Featured Image (open the job post and add Featured image). But be aware that manual changes in the job posts texts are overridden by the next vacancy sync, but as the featured image is not part of vacancy syncs it won't be removed)
You can check by forcing a manual sync: Located in **Wordpress ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Carerix ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Tab Settings ‚Üí Button** '**Synchronize new/changed items from Carerix**'.

### Can I show a featured image in a vacancy post?

Yes, go to **Wordpress Dashboard** ‚Üí **Carerix** ‚Üí **Sources**
In the 'Publication Details Header/Body/Footer' (or in the Header or Boday) of a source, you can use HTML and Shortcodes to build your own template. 
For example use the shortcode `[cx_apply_form]` (instead of `[cx_apply_form]` which generates a button) in the Publication Details Footer.

### Can I add an image within the paragraphs of the vacancy texts?
Yes, you can add HTML or a shortcode in the publication text in the Carerix application. 
Be aware that the Carerix user would need a little bit of HTML experience to add this to the publication text.

2. Switch the editor to HTML mode
3. Insert the HTML-image-tag in the HTML source code. For example:

4. Save the changes
5. Sync the WordPress plugin on the website

* In Google Analytics you can track the statistics of this page
* You could also add this confirmation page as one of your Goals

üî¥ CHECKEN: Also see [Applicant Source Tracking](#applicant-source-tracking) for tracking candidates in Carerix throughout their application process.

### How to search / filter by taxonomy?
Jobs include taxonomy by Country and Region, Function and Training. Use those taxonomies in your  Search & Filter widgets of plugins.

### üî¥ CHECKEN: Can I use a search radius from a postal code area?
With the 'Carerix Search widget' it is possible to search by radius. These can be found under Wordpress ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí View ‚Üí Widgets. You need WordPress editing rights. However, if you use a third party search-plugin (like Search & Filter or Jet SmartFilters) you cannot use this radius function because of technical limitations.
See the example in https://demo.carerix.com/plugin/zoeken-filteren/


### Can I change the Layout or styling of the vacancies?
Yes, the plugin has minimal styling so it basically follows the theme used. Additionally, you can build your own template layout of the vacancies with HTML and Shortcodes in 'Publication Details Header/Body/Footer within the source.

### Can I change the text of the headings, labels, buttons for vacancy texts and application forms?
Yes you can! You can build a template with the use of shortcodes in combination with HTML.
(see [Sources](#sources))

### Can I offer an RSS feed of all job vacancies or by function?
Yes, you can use standard WordPress RSS feeds. The URLs for this example:
* /category-name/publications/feed /
* /tag/utrecht/feed/

For example https://plugin.carerix.com/category/vacatures/techniek-engineering/feed/

### Can I submit a sitemap to Google Search Console?
Yes, use the following URL:
https://domain.com/?carerix_sitemap

### When I enable 'Google For Jobs' why do I get warnings from a (structured data) testing tool?
These are warnings and not blocking errors.

Google recommends you to provide detailed information about the vacancies. At the moment it's not possible to fully map the Carerix vacancy information to the Google For Jobs structure. But the most important data is covered.

Also, Google For Jobs wants to know the address location of the jobs. Not all customers want to reveal this because it's sensitive business information. Therefor this high level of detail is left out.

### Can I customize the labels in the URL (such as ../category/, ../publications/ etc)?
No, this is not possible

### Why should I enable this: 'Reporting its location'?
We can continue to make the plugin better and better with the necessary feedback that we receive from the plugin. No vacancy or candidate data is send, so there is no privacy issue, and it gives no performance issues.


### How to enable logging and where is the logfile?
You can enable the logging in Wordpress ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Carerix ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Tab Settings. The logfile is created in
{WORDPRESS-ROOT}/wp-content/plugins/CxWordpress/tmp/logs/
> [!WARNING] 
> The logfile directory can grow fast in size which may lead to your site running out of disk space. So make sure you **only** enable it if you experience problems.

### Where are the uploaded documents?
Candidate documents (e.g. a CV because of a job application) are submitted to the Carerix system, but temporarily uploaded to the following folder to process it:
{WORDPRESS-ROOT}/wp-content/plugins/CxWordpress/tmp/uploads/
After a few hours the files are automatically removed by the plugin and will only reside in the Carerix system.
> [!WARNING]
> Make sure you have disabled ‚Äúdevelopers logging‚Äù (see above), because candidate details (needed for debugging) are stored in the logfile too.

### üî¥ CHECKEN: I see tailstocks without text
Perhaps there is a space in your publication text. Because the field contains the text shown on the website, including the head. Check the according publication text in the Carerix application, as in the example above:
You can also clean the publication text by clicking on the button 'Code' and ing the code. In this case some HTML knowledge would be handy. In this case you have to remove the code `<p>&#160;</p>`


### Why does the plugin not use Custom Post Types instead of regular posts for vacancies?
**Pro's**
* Templates: Web builder can use a custom template specifically for job post types.
* Filters: 3rd Party filters specifically for Custom post types are set
* Consistency: Difference between news and jobs is clearly in the admin area.

**Cons**
* Blog post listings: It is not possible to show vacancies in major blog listing.
* Compatibility: Switch between regular and post types Custom post types can cause synchronization problems.


Currently we have chosen to jobs not offering as Custom Post Types because many of our customers use the standard features like blog listing.

## Create RSS feeds per category

Build an RSS feed for all your jobs as posts in WordPress or build a Feed for each Category or any tag. Use the built-in feature of WordPress for generating feeds.

Ex: Build the feed for **category = publications** on website

like this:


```
https://example.com/category/publications/feed
```


This will result in a standard RSS page containing all posts from category publications as generated by the Carerix plugin.


## Applicant Source Tracking

üî¥ CHECKEN: The apply page supports 2 new GET parameters cx_applysource and cx_applytags as of version 2.14.36


## Usage example


```
https://example.com/vacancy/1234/apply?cx_applysource=Google&cx_applytags=jobboard.nl,paid,regionA
```


NOTE: The apply parameters are being stored in a cookie for 30 days. If the same candidate applies for another vacancy through another URL e.g. When a candidate submits the apply form the tracking values will be automatically saved in Match details and become visible in Carerix application as Apply Source and Apply Tags fields in Matches details.

If your wordpress is configured differently and you are not using default urls, be sure that the redirect from the job board will land on the apply page. Usually it is enough to provide apply=true parameter in the url


```
https://example.com/vacancy/9876/apply
```


The resulting match will be created with previous tracking values.
