üî¥ KLOPT DIT NOG?
You need to have these email templates installed to make full use of the plugin: Email codes (System, CxWordPress)

Make sure that this e-mail templates are installed in the library of the Carerix application:

* CxpeForgotPwd - e-mail sent to the candidate to resend the login details
* CxpResetPwd - email used to reset the password for a candidate That can no longer access the original email account
* JobAlert - Mandatory for sending job alert subscription emails.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## Authorisation of the Plugin for the specified Carerix application
> 
> The plugin needs to be authenticated with the Carerix application. Therefor you need the Application name (which can be derived from applicationname.carerix.net) and the Application Token. 
> 
> The Admin of a Carerix application can generate an Application Token. If you don't have access to the Carerix application you can ask an admin. He can provide you the Application token using the email template 'Application Token'.
> Or request a token via our Helpdesk ([support@carerix.com](mailto:support@carerix.com)) \
> Carerix will not be able to provide you the Application token directly, as this is part of the authorization procedure.


## Change ApplyURL to website

Don't forget to change the ApplyURL, so that links in email templates are directed to the correct Vacancies on the website (Settings ‚Üí  Attributes and fields ‚Üí  Apply_url)

```
https://domainname.com/?pub_id=<cx:write value="$publication.publicationID"/>
```

This will link to the according Vacancy publication on the website

* Change ApplyURL
* Don't forget to change the ApplyURL, so that links in emailtemplates are directed to the website
Settings ‚Üí Attributes and fields ‚Üí Apply_url

    ```
    https://domainname.com/?pub_id=<cx:write value="$publication.publicationID"/>
    ```

    This will link to the according Vacancy publication on the website

### Create links in your emails, alerts and newsletters
* Use above this cx-script code in your Carerix email templates to create urls to the jobs in your emails, alerts and newsletters:
```<cx:write value="$publication.publicationID"/>```

That will generate a link with the correct vacancy page URL: [https://domainname.com/pubid/xxx](https://domainname.com/pubid/xxx), where xxx is the pubID \
For example [https://domainname.com/pubid/123](https://domainnamee.com/pubid/123)

> 4. Go to the external link [https://website.com/?carerix_sync](https://website.com/?carerix_sync) that is available without logging in. After syncing a log of that last sync will be displayed.

## Forms

By default a form named Form 1 is ready for use. This default form can not be changed. Create your a new form if you want to customize your application form:
1. Each apply form can also be used for different kind of publications (see settings under [Sources](#sources --> Apply Form) )
2. The **Synchronize with Carerix button** checks if fields that use values from the Carerix System are available. For example, if it can not find any values for the Nationality field, that field will be disabled.
3. Set each fields to Visible of Required
4. You can reorder fields with drag and drop and you can drag & drop whole sections (on the right side)
5. Copy paste the shortcode of the form to the page where you want to use it as an 'Open Application form', for example:
```
[cx_open_application openFormID="2"]
```

See the parameters for Open Application below

### Open Application form

<table>
   <tr>
      <td>[cx_open_application]</th>
      <td>Use this shortcode in the content of a page</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>[cx_open_application openFormID="XX"]</td>
      <td>Use for a specific application form. Replace 'XX' by the application form ID. You can find the ID in the application forms list (Wordpress ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Carerix ‚Üí Application Forms).</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>[cx_open_application openpubid="XX"]</td>
      <td>If you have multiple open vacancies in your Carerix system, you can add the Carerix publication-ID of the specific open vacancy as a parameter.
	      <BR/>
         Replace 'XX' by the ID of the publication of the open vacancy job order
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>[cx_open_application openFormID="3" openpubid="312"]</td>
      <td>You can combine the two parameters like this</td>
   </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>



### Configuring a custom Form
Show login link: set to Yes by default. If enabled, it generates the login link in the job details page.
Extra apply options: Set to no by default. If enabled it generates the Apply with Linkedin link
Address format: International / Dutch. For Dutch each field is split on it's own form field while for International the entire addres can be inserted in one textarea.
Agreement link:
* Default: no agreement link
* Insert desired text in the ‚ÄúAgreement Label‚Äù and in ‚ÄúAgreement text‚Äù fields to generate and display the link.
* Insert an URL to be associated with the agreement text url. If Agreement URL field is filled it takes precedent over the Agreement text.
* Captcha: choose in which page to display the Captcha code
* Advanced: Clear Datanodes Cache. If you made a change in the Carerix System to one of the DataNodes used here, you should clean the cache.


## Sources

Under the Sources section you can create one or more Jobs sources. You can use the Default jobs source or you can create new ones. Create a different source if you want to:

* Use a different other settings or a different template lay out for your vacancy posts
* Use a different Carerix  'medium'-code (like 'web' or 'web2' or 'web-en')

### Configuring a Job source

1. Add a new Jobs source click via Add New button.
2. When you Add or edit a Source you need to synchronize to see changes
3. Deleting a source will not delete the generated posts from wordpress but only that specific source
4. The following fields can be set:

* **Source name** \
Helps you to identify the configured source.

* **Publications Details Options** \
Here you can set options for how the applicant will see and interact with the vacancy posts generated from this source.
üî¥IMAGE

* **Apply Form** \
Select the Application Form to be used for this specific Source

* **Title - Location** \
Select if you want to show the work location after the Title or not.

* **Set Alternative Feed Source Parameters** \
You can specify a different 'medium'-code here. It's useful if you have multiple sites or brands with different sets of vacancies. Therefore these 'medium'-codes are active and in use in the Carerix application.
üî¥IMAGE

* **Publication Details Header and Publication Details Footer** \
If you want to display details in the footer or the header, use the following shortcodes:

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

* **Publication Excerpt**
Here you can use an alternative/better teaser (summary text) which will be used as a summary, specifically in vacancy overview/listing pages. This excerpt will also be used as intro/description text as preview text on Social Media etc.

* **Publication Details Body**
You can use shortcodes like [cx_intro_information], [cx_offer_information] and many more to setup your own vacancy layout template. See the shortcodes in the plugin for exact usage. Please read the accompanying usage explanation in the plugin as you are configuring the job source.
üî¥IMAGE

### üî¥ Shortcodes for Publication body
üî¥ \[SHORTCODES\]



## Job Alert Subscription
You can create a standalone Job Alert Subscription page, using the the `[cx_job_alert_subscription]` shortcode.

In WordPress you can use this shortcode to show a form for job alerts (vacancy subscription). When candidates signup they will receive emails in the future containing vacancies that fit their selected criteria, on a daily basis.

`üî¥ See the example in`

The following fields will be displayed in the form:

* Email address
* First name
* Last name (and prefix)
* Gender
* Country selection preference (only if multiple countries are published in Carerix)
* Three ‚Äúsub region‚Äù selector preferences like provinces, counties and departments (only if these are published in Carerix)
* Two function group preferences with an optional parent business-line selector (the business-line selector will only appear if multiple business-lines are published in Carerix)
* Agreement to terms checkbox (also enforces the storage term of the personal information to comply to GDPR)
* Anti bot abuse system (by captcha)

The process for the candidate is as follows:

1. Candidate selects the criteria to receive job opportunities for and submits the form
2. Candidate receives an opt-in activation mail and clicks on the activation link
3. Candidate starts receiving mail with (new) vacancies on a daily basis that match the selected criteria
4. To cancel, the candidate can use the unsubscribe link in the job alert mails

### Jobalert Step 1: Preparation in Carerix

Follow the steps in the following help article:


1. Follow the steps in the following help article: [Helpdeks: Job alert](https://help.carerix.com/en/articles/1954170)
2. Make sure the email template called ‚ÄúVacature abonnement bevestiging‚Äù (Vacancy subscription confirmation) is also installed. It has the \
code `web-subscribe` and it's not described in the help article.


### Jobalert Step 2: Preparation in Wordpress

Create a general page and paste the following shortcode in the content:


```
[cx_job_alert_subscription]
```


Optional attributes are can be added to control the confirmation message.

Set a custom confirmation message:


```
[cx_job_alert_subscription confirmation_message="Thank you for subscribing. Shortly you will receive an email with an activation link. After activation you will start receiving new job opportunities in your mailbox on a daily basis!"]
```


Set a custom page/url for the confirmation message:


```
[cx_job_alert_subscription confirmation_url="/jobalert_thank_you/"]
```



### Jobalert Step 3: Fine-tuning in Carerix

In Carerix, you can fine-tune the following candidate criteria for the job alert form:

* Country selection
* Business-line selection
* Function group selection

For the following instructions you need to be familiar with Carerix Tables editing. The principles explained in[ Table management](https://help.carerix.com/en/articles/1810726) are used to edit the tables.

The following table items are used:

* For countries the table 'Land' (country)
* For business-lines the table 'Vakgebied' (business-line)
* For function groups the table 'functie0'

#### Shorten the country selection

If your working area is a single country (or a few) you can shorten the dropdown box of countries.

For each country you want to disable in the job alert form, edit the item, and uncheck the box ‚Äúnot for web‚Äù. \
Note: if you only enable one country, the country selection is disabled on the job alert form.

#### Shorten the business-line selection

In Carerix every function group can be connected to a business-line. If one or more function groups are connected to a business-line the business-line dropdown box on the jobalert form will appear. So if you don't work with multiple business-lines, you need to configure the business-lines as follows:

1. Edit each business-line item in the table ‚Äúvakgebied‚Äù (business-line) and enable the checkbox ‚Äúnot for web‚Äù
2. Locate the business-line ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù (default) and disable the checkbox ‚Äúnot for web‚Äù. This leaves you with one mandatory business-line which will NOT appear for candidates on the job alert form
3. Finally, in Wordpress, go to Dashboard ‚Üí Carerix ‚Üí Application Forms ‚Üí Tab: Settings, and click on ‚ÄúClear DataNodes cache‚Äù

#### Configure/shorten function group selection

1. Edit each function group item (table: functie0) you want to include in the group selection for the candidates. Disable 'not for web' and enable each desired business-line you want to connect the function group to. You need at least connect it to one business-line
2. Finally, in Wordpress, go to Dashboard ‚Üí Carerix ‚Üí Application Forms ‚Üí Tab: Settings, and click on ‚ÄúClear DataNodes cache‚Äù



---


## Diagnostics (since v3.0.0)

The jobs synchronizing process will be fully handled by the REST API. The diagnostics tool (Wordpress Dashboard ‚Üí Carerix ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Tab Diagnostics) will help you find possible inconsistencies between published vacancies in your Carerix system and the vacancies that are retrieved by your Wordpress site.

You can review the 'active job publications' but also the available 'medium codes'.

## 4. Advanced Features (Optional)

* For developers or experienced users, this section can cover:
    * Hooks and filters used by the plugin.
    * Custom functions available.
    * Integration with other plugins or WordPress APIs.

_____________


## Special jobs
üî¥ CHECKEN
Website in one language but do you want multiple languages used for publication texts?
If you have a website entirely in Dutch but you want to display one or more jobs in a different language? By default, your publications will receive all header sections in Dutch. take the following steps in order to have the labels in the correct language.

**In Carerix:**
1. If an extra medium for language is not already active: Create a medium with the desired code (i.e. 'web-en') for use of publications in the different language of the website.
2. Create publications in this medium in the extra language that you need to publish

**In the WordPress plugin** (under Sources)

1. Create new source to generate your jobs page. **Eg. Page name: Mixed jobs**
2. In the Set Feed Source Parameters section, after the default feed, in the input text insert **Eg. for English:** `medium=web|web-en`
3. If you want to mix the Vacancy posts from the different languages you can use `medium=web|web-en`. 
4. Finish the rest of settings and save.

**Result:** Page named **Mixed Jobs** is created. The page will display jobs from the 2 defined mediums.

For the posts for which value of parameter medium is found to be language codes, the resources will be generated in the language code corresponding to language code. 

**NOTE**: If you do not want to use multilanguage-features, never use a mediumcode containing a dash. The Wordpress plugin will interpret it as a language resulting in English subtitles within your vacancies. So if you want to use a medium to separate vacancies for your second agency, use a mediumcode like ‚Äúwebagency2‚Äù instead of ‚Äúweb-agency2‚Äù


## Extra/Additional Carerix fields support (since v3.0.0)

You can find the feature in Carerix Dashboard‚ÜíCarerix‚ÜíSettings‚Üí tab Technology previews

In the Carerix system extra/additional fields can be added to Job orders and Publications. The information from these custom fields can be displayed in your vacancies. You can also use it as options in a ‚Äúvacancy-listing search&filter‚Äù widget.

**Use case**

A nice use case is a ‚Äúfeatured/highlighted‚Äù vacancy widget to highlight some vacancies. Therefore in Carerix you need to create an additional field called ‚Äúfeatured on website‚Äù (type single checkbox) and attach it to the ‚ÄúPublications entity‚Äù.  \
In Carerix, recruiters can tag preferred publications as ‚ÄúFeatured on website‚Äù.  \
 \
After that, the Wordpress developer can create a ‚ÄúFeatured vacancies widget‚Äù based on a ‚Äúvacancy post loop‚Äù restricted to the custom-field ‚Äúfeatured on website‚Äù.


## Google for Jobs

Google for Jobs is an enhanced search widget that aggregates listings from job boards and vacancy sites and displays them prominently in Google search.

To have your jobs included you need to add ‚Äústructured job posting data‚Äù to your job pages. This information is invisible, so your job pages are still looking the same. When Google is indexing your site, the structured data is recognized and added to Google for Jobs.

**Enabling and testing Google for Jobs**
* Carerix ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Tab 'Google for jobs'
* Enable 'Google for Jobs support' and click on save changes
* Navigate to a vacancy information page of your choice at the front-end of your site
* Copy/paste the URL of the former step in the Google Structured Data testing tool:
* You will see the JobPosting entity is detected. The tool might give some warnings about recommended fields. Currently this information is not available in the CX WP plugin.

**Configuring yourself as hiring organization**

The hiring organization is also included in Google for Jobs. If you don't mark your jobs as ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù, your client (hiring organization) will be displayed. For jobs marked as anonymous you can put your own organization name as the hiring one. To do this fill in your own company name in the field ‚ÄúHiring organization‚Äù. Optionally you can also add your company logo.


## Job Conversion Tracking for web analytics

The Cx WP plugin supports custom code snippets for extended web analytics usage (e.g. Facebook pixel, Google Analytics, etc.)
Custom (javascript) code can be applied to the following webpage sections:


* General (basically  to all pages)
* Job description page
* Job application page
* Job application confirmation page

Additionally custom information (apply source and apply tags) can be set which will be stored in the ‚ÄúCandidate Match file‚Äù.

Configuring custom conversion/tracking code


* Note: understanding of/some skills in JavaScript is required
* As an administrator from your Wordpress Dashboard, navigate to Carerix ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Tab 'Conversion tracking'
* Enter valid javascript code including &lt;script>-tags in the corresponding text-boxes
* You can access special global variables holding information like publication-ID, vacancy-ID and job title. The available variables names are displayed in the blue information box. Tip: you can also dump this information in your browser debug console by entering console.log(cx); at a vacancy description page.
* Finally you can use the methods cx.setApplySource() and cx.setApplyTags() to add extra information to the application (retrievable in the Carerix system under 'Matches')


## Taxonomies

The plugin is generating Taxonomies for Jobs posts:

**Jobs**

* Countries - Country
* Regions - Region
* Educations - Education 0
* Functiongroup - Function 0
* Functions - Function 1
* Work locations - Publication work location

In order to use the taxonomies as filters for the 2 types of posts, the names of the taxonomies must be distinct. Otherwise, if common, the values of the taxonomies will be displayed for both type of posts and the user will experience that after sellecting a taxonomy no result will be returned.

Default resources are used to generate the names of the taxonomies. The language applied will follow the language of the plugin.

Define your own values for the taxonomies creating for each languge a different / new value to overwrite the default ones filled from resources.

# Multilingual Websites

The Carerix WordPress plugin supports multilingualism. To do this, you use a multilingual plugin. Carerix supports [Multilingual Plugin WPML](http://wpml.org/), the most popular plugin on multilingualism. We assume that you all vacancies in both Dutch as a 2nd language publishing (English in this example). Proceed as follows

1. Make Carerix in another medium (in tables). You've already medium 'web', add a new medium to eg code web-en 'for English.
2. Create an additional publications of a job
3. One publication (1st language) already has the medium `web`. Make an extra publication of the same job and web (2nd language) with it. Please note that this publication contains the texts in the 2nd language.
4. Go to the WordPress Website
5. Install WPML and adjust it as desired
6. Go to the Carerix settings and synchronize all items Carerix
7. In the list of all messages (posts) you can see which posts have been published in any language

NB: Please note that the 'Translation Options' of WPML are good.

1. WPML ‚Üí Translate Options
2. Optionally sync again

## Without multilingual plugin


IMPORTANT! You can do steps below only in case when WPML plugin is NOT installed. If you have WPML plugin please skip this section!

You can also show jobs from different languages ‚Äã‚Äã(different mediums) without multilingual plugin:

1. Create a medium (per language) a separate job to feed source,
2. On Set Feed Source Parameters Add `medium=web` and as parameter behind `/cxtools/wp_feed.php?`
3. You now have several job feeds, jobs are created as separate jobs in the'd really rather know categories. The page is created only displays the jobs with the medium 'and web.

```


NOTE: The apply parameters are being stored in a cookie for 30 days. If the same candidate applies for another vacancy through another URL e.g. When a candidate submits the apply form the tracking values will be automatically saved in Match details and become visible in Carerix application as Apply Source and Apply Tags fields in Matches details.

If your wordpress is configured differently and you are not using default urls, be sure that the redirect from the job board will land on the apply page. Usually it is enough to provide apply=true parameter in the url


```
https://example.com/vacancy/9876/apply
```


The resulting match will be created with previous tracking values.
